In our current system, a patient's medical records are maintained by the hospital and are not available to the patient. This creates difficulty when visiting a different hospital.Our website solves this problem by allowing users to save their medical records , so that they can easily share it to their doctors.It will also have a feature which allows the user to set remainders for taking medication.
